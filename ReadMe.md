# DDDNorth F# Presentation #

*12th October 2013*

## You've learnt the basics of F#: What's next? ##

F# has some of the coolest real-world features available in any programming language. In this session, Iâ€™m going to introduce you to two of them; Type Providers and the MailboxProcessor. Type Providers make handling data from many disparate sources a breeze and the MailboxProcessor will allow you to easily create highly scalable concurrent applications. Come along to this session to see some of the reasons why F# is rapidly gaining traction within the .Net community.

This repository contains the Powerpoint presentation and the demos for Type Providers and the initial MailboxProcessor examples.  The main demo for the Chat Server was written by Tomas Petricek and is available from http://tomasp.net/blog/education-and-agents-talks.aspx/.
